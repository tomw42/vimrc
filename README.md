Vim Settings
============

This is just to share my vim settings and bundles I'm currently using
on my jurney of a progressing vimification.
The stack of vim plugins is mainly targeted at web development with Coffescript, Jade, Stylus and using Brunch as a build system.

.vimrc
------

The .vimrc is structured into the respective settings sections and is rather self-explanatory. The settings cover basically development in Coffescript, VALA, and Python.
